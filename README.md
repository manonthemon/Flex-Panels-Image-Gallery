## Description

This is a an example of JS working with CSS to control on page transitions. The project leans heavily on CSS with flex box and uses JS to control click events and change CSS classes on certain elements to activate transition events. Writing this code allowed me to:

<li>Practice writing JS code, namely event listeners, query selectors and functions.</li>
<li>Practice writing CSS code, especially flex box.</li>
<li>Practice GitHub workflow. </li><br>
